1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
    The three dogs, the list of dogs, and the comparator
    
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
The constructor call is right before the class definition for the Comparator. The class definition is built into the comparator call and is written where the collections sort method is being used.
